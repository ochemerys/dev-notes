When docker creates a swarm cluster a special overlay network called ingress 
network is created to properly route external requests outside the cluster to services 
which are publishing ports. 
This network exists to serve one purpose only, to facilitate routing such requests.

Even though it shows up in network listings 
it should not be used as a normal network to discover services 
which are attached to them 
or facilitate internal load balancing between these services.

To block such unintentional behavior the following needs to happen:
	- Disable service discovery in ingress network
	- Block services explicitly trying to attach to ingress network
	- Allow only access to published ports 
	  when traffic is coming to any container via ingress network
